## Installation

This application depends on [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/), and was
tested under Node **v8.11.2**.
Additionally, you may install [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/en/docs/install) as
the package manager (tested under Yarn **v1.12.1** and NPM **v5.6.0**).

Once the prerequisites are installed on the target system, run,

```sh
$ yarn # to use yarn as the package manager, or
$ npm install # to use NPM as the package manager.
```

## Usage

### Development Environment

Once the application is installed, you may run the application by invoking,

```sh
$ yarn start # Or,
$ npm run start 
```

The above command will run the application on
[http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000). If port `3000` is occupied,
a script will prompt to run the application on the next available port.

You may verify the correctness of the current state of the application by
running available tests using,

```sh
$ yarn test # Or,
$ npm test
```

### Production and Staging Environments

A production build can be generated by running,

```sh
$ yarn build # Or,
$ npm run build
```

This will produce the production build files under `./build` directory.
